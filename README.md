# TestVagrant2
Written the Test using JAVAScript+TestNG+Selenium using Paga Object Model
I have created one Pakage (TestVagrantTechnologies.TestVagrant1) with Class WebPage where I have used all the XPath of both the Website: IMDB and Wiki
Also created another Pakage (Utils) with Class Build Test) where I have used which browser should be used.

And in last I have created 2 Parent Class:
 1)WebTestPageofWiki
 2)WebTestPageofIBDM
 
 From that I have taken the output Of Relase Date and Country from both the website and compare them. From that Country name is same from both the web page but Relase date does not matches from both the website.
